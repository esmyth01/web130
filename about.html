<p>I grew up in central Michigan. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2008
with a BA. I enjoy many different activities but the ones I love most
usually involve the outdoors. In particular I love to fly fish and
downhill ski. I moved to Seattle in 2008, and absolutely love it out
here. The people, the culture, and outdoor lifestyle coincide perfectly
with my personality.</p>
